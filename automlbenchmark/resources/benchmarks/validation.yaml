# kc1 target classes are (true, false).
# This causes issues if the framework is using Pandas when obtaining predictions:
#   pandas will automatically convert ("true", "false") strings to (True, False) booleans which will then be reconverted to ("True", "False") when saved to csv.
# for those cases, Pandas should be avoided at that particular time or string type/conversion should be enforced for target predictions column.
# cf. H2OAutoML where pandas could be avoided when reading predictions.

# APSFailure doesn't have its target as last column by default.
# cf. AutoWEKA for an example to handle this case if the framework requires the target in a specific position.
